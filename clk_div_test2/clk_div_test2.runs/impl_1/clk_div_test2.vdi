WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net clk_div_ce/ce is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_div_ce/ce_INST_0/O, cell clk_div_ce/ce_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT clk_div_ce/ce_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 25 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
counter/count_reg[0], counter/count_reg[10], counter/count_reg[11], counter/count_reg[12], counter/count_reg[13], counter/count_reg[14], counter/count_reg[15], counter/count_reg[16], counter/count_reg[17], counter/count_reg[18], counter/count_reg[19], counter/count_reg[1], counter/count_reg[20], counter/count_reg[21], counter/count_reg[22]... and (the first 15 of 25 listed)
